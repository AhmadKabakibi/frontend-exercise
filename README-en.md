## Assignment: 
Create a clone of this repo and setup a webapp wich a multiple-select-filter. See details below. Our goal is to get an idea of how you setup a webapp and overcome technical challenges.

## Given assets:
* JSON file with data entries for the multi-select (470 items)
* Multi-select design
* Search-icon (svg)

## Requirements:
* Show the multi-select and fill it with the given JSON data
* Create a search which can filter the JSON data
* Make it possible to select multiple items
* Selected items need to be ordered on top, also they should not be affected by the search filter
* BONUS: store the selected items locally. They should persist after page reload.

## Primary criteria:
* HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS
* JS architecture (ex. MVC pattern)
* HTTP/REST
* ES6 / TypeScript

## Secondary criteria:
* Advanced css (Less/Sass/Responsive/?)
* Data storage
* Build street setup (npm/gulp/webpack/?)

## Takeaways:
* You write well structured code (use common practices / coding patterns)
* It ok if you do not finish the project. Our goal is to get an insight of your skills. Though it helps if (part of) the code works ;)
* It's a plus if you use Typescript of ES6
* It's a plus if you do TDD or BDD
